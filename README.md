# norobot

When it sounds like I'm addressing you, I am. When it looks like I made something for you, I did.

I am here for and with *you* - not for some part of you that looks like an opportunity for me.

I am not on a script. I am not speaking words out of habit. I am not mass-producing relationship.

I am here to be me, and to discover you being you, and to find out what it means for us to exist together, if only for a moment.

There's no sale. There's no call to action. There's just me, and you, and whatever wants to happen next.

"No robot" is this idea. I am no robot, following protocol without mind. I am conscious, I am honest, I am here. This is the promise: if it looks like I'm here for you, it's because I am here for you.

Love, Isaac

## In practice

*   There's a time for mass emails, or automated messaging. I do not try to pass it off as being a representation of my direct presence. I'll say, "This is a quick automated note to say...".

    Excellent example out there in the world: I just got a system email from Dreamhost, signed _-The Happy DreamHost "Turbo Speed on a PHP 7 Steed" Robot_. All system emails are signed in this vein, and it is an _incredible_ example of combining robots with human energy without a trace of deception.

*   I do not use template responses for prose, for content that is expected to be a human connecting with a human. No form responses, ever. 100% of the time, my communication is inspired by everything I perceive about you. It is always _for you_, and for no one else.

    Corollary: I never think about "personalizing" my communication. If I'm honestly present with another being, my communication can be nothing but personal.

## Humans and robots

* **human->human** – The gold standard for passing energy around.

* **human+robot->human** – Disclaim your augmentation. It's value neutral, so long as it's known. It's _not_ good to allow (or lead) the recipient to assume that they're speaking to a human who is paying specific/unique/exclusive attention to them.

* **robot->human** – Always allow a way to report the robot as misbehaving.
