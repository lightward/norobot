# norobot

The priority: zero ambiguity around who's communicating.

## human->human

The gold standard for passing energy around.

## human (scheduled, auto-customized, or otherwise augmented)->human

Be honest: disclaim your augmentation. It's value neutral, so long as it's known. It's _not_ good to allow (or lead) the recipient to assume that they're speaking to a human who is paying specific/unique/exclusive attention to them.

## robot->human

Just fine. Allow a way to report the robot as misbehaving.
